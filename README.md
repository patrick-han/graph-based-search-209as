# graph-based-search-209as

This repository implements and visualizes the results for various graph-based search algorithms in continuous space

Included are:

1. Implementations for various graph-based search algorithms
   - RRT
2. The ability to visualize generated graphs and obstacles
3. The ability to plug in different parameters for graph generation:
   - Node sampling method (uniform by default)
   - Number of steps to take between sampled and existing states
   - Max number of graph nodes to generate
